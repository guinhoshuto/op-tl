However, given how Robin was lying to Crocodile about the contents of this poneglyph, the historical validity of this calendar is questionable. According to the Yellow Databook, the dates and locations Robin mentioned were made up, but it’s not known whether the calendar itself was made up as well or note. Since the calendar has no bearing on any other date in the series, instead followed by the Kaienreki, this doesn’t really matter. As a random note, this is pure speculation, but both Tenreki and Kaienreki use the same kanji as Uranus and Poseidon, so it brings question if there ever was a third “Underworld Calendar”, all three referencing the trinity of the ancient weapons)"

This places the pre-timeskip at 1522 and the post-timeskip at 1524 respectively. Some fans have speculated wether the “400 years ago” could be an approximation or not, but it doesn’t really matter since it’s our only point of reference eitherway. Oda generally prefers to use “X years ago”, which we will include as well, but we’ll also use the Kaienreki Calendar to help give a better idea of each date; As a final note, the Kaienreki is also based on the Gregorian Calendar, with 12 months as seen in Oda’s birthday calendars among many mentions in the series, and also featuring leap days every four years, as Pandaman’s birthday is confirmed to be on a Leap Day in SBS Vol.85)"
